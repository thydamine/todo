# Blackboard

Blackboard is a project management app designed for student groups. It combines three core components into a single remote working area: discussion, task management, and a simple file sharing system.

## How to Run
Download the entire archive and open the "index.html" file. All file names are relative, so the page should run in a browser and reach out to all dependencies regardless of the folder you put it in.

You can either pull the repo using Git (if you're familiar with the software) or download the Zip file manually by clicking the green "Code" button above.
